// Package atelier is a Go library providing a set of algorithms, data structures, APIs and helpers to resort to
// when in need.
//
// It is essentially my personal library of Go code, in a single place, easily accessible. Types, tools, helpers, that
// I use on a recurrent basis, and that I don't want to rewrite every time I need them.
